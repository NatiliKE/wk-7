ðŸŽ¬ Interactive Web Pages with CSS & JavaScript
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create visually dynamic and interactive web pages by combining CSS3 animations with JavaScript functions.
It includes:

Smooth CSS transitions and keyframe animations

Custom JavaScript functions using parameters, return values, and scope

Dynamic interaction between CSS and JavaScript through event handling

By the end, the page responds visually and functionally to user actions, creating a mini interactive experience.
